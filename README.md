For this Qliro Project, I have to implement that Figma design that I have received. I did my best to implement that design. If I would be working on this project full time I would make some design changes to make the page look nicer. 

I would also suggest that if we are making this website for accessibility we should be careful with colors and typography. I would suggest using the library that fits the need for this. I would like to work more on this project and come up with more ideas to make this feature better for users.

To work on this project I did my research on google, stack overflow, medium, and some other websites. 

 I also ran the Unit test on this app. Which was passed.For testing I have used React testing library. Here is the picture of the testing Results.
